== Description

This library provides a high-level API for simple user interfaces with
kdialog (forthcoming: dialog/zenity/yad/cocoadialog)

Sometimes, being usable matters.  In addition to providing the world's most
intricate command suite and option parsing for expert users, it might be nice
to just give a little interface.  Not so much that you have to restructure
your whole program around some GUI framework, but if you need a filename
or a little text entry box or a confirmation box, the "dialog"-like programs
can make the job a lot easier.

This is intended to make it easy for you, as a programmer, to make your
programs easier to use.  Everyone wins, right?

Further documentation can be generated with by running 'rake'

== Requirements

Ruby 2.0 or newer

One of:

* kdialog

In the future, other variations of the 'dialog' program will be supported.

== Installation

  gem install dialog-fu 

== Use

----
require 'dialog-fu'

Dialog.autosetup  # Figure out what implementation to use

Dialog.messagebox("Hello, world")
----
